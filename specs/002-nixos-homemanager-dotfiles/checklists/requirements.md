# Specification Quality Checklist: Flakes Migration + Home Manager + 1Password Dotfile Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation.
- The spec mentions `op://` URIs in the Key Entities section as an example of a secret reference pattern — this is acceptable as a domain concept illustration, not an implementation directive.
- The spec references specific existing configuration values (plugin names, themes, hostname) as acceptance criteria inputs — these are current-state facts, not implementation choices.
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
